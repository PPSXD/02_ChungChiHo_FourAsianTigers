        <h1>History</h1>
        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>In <span class="year">1997</span>, led by developer Harace Lin, the Taipei Financial Center Corporation, a team led by several Taiwan banks and insurance companies, won the rights to lease the site for 70 years and develop a building, placing the winning bid of NT$20,688,890,000 for the Build Operate Transfer agreement with the city government.</p>

        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <p>Planning for Taipei 101 began in July <span class="year">1997</span> during Chen Shui-bian's term as Taipei mayor. Talks between merchants and city government officials initially centered on a proposal for a 66-story tower to serve as an anchor for new development in Taipei's 101 business district. Planners were considering taking the new structure to a more ambitious height only after an expat suggested it, along with many of the other features used in the design of the building. It was not until the summer of <span class="year">2000</span> that the city granted a license for the construction of a 101-story tower on the site. In the meantime, construction proceeded and the first tower column was erected in the summer of <span class="year">2001</span>.</p>

        <p>A major earthquake struck Taiwan on 31 March <span class="year">2002</span>, sending a construction crane falling from the 56th floor to Xinyi Road. The crane crushed several vehicles and caused five deaths - two crane operators and three workers who were not properly harnessed. However, an inspection showed no structural damage to the building, and construction work was able to restart within a week.</p>

        <p>Taipei 101's roof was completed three years later on 1 July <span class="year">2003</span>. In <span class="year">2004</span>, work on Taipei 101 was completed by Samsung C&T, a South Korean construction company.Ma Ying-jeou, in his first term as Taipei mayor, fastened a golden bolt to signify the achievement. The formal opening of the tower took place on New Year's Eve <span class="year">2004</span>. President Chen Shui-bian, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng cut the ribbon. Open-air concerts featured a number of popular performers, including singers A-Mei and Stefanie Sun. Visitors rode the elevators to the Observatory for the first time. A few hours later the first fireworks show at Taipei 101 heralded the arrival of a new year. It replaced the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur as the world's tallest building.</p>

        
        <h3>Post-construction</h3>
        <p>The Taipei Financial Center Corporation (TFCC) announced plans on 2 November <span class="year">2009</span> to make Taipei 101 "the world's tallest green building" by summer of <span class="year">2011</span> as measured by LEED standards. The structure was already designed to be energy-efficient, with double-pane windows blocking external heat by 50% and recycled water meeting 20â€“30% of the building's needs. LEED certification would entail inspections and upgrades in wiring, water and lighting equipment at a cost of NT$60 million (US$1.8 million). Estimates showed the savings resulting from the modifications paid for the cost of making them within three years. The project was carried out under the guidance of an international team composed of Siemens Building Technologies, architect and interior designer Steven Leach Group and the LEED advisory firm EcoTech International. The company applied for a platinum-degree certification with LEED in early <span class="year">2011</span>. On 28 July <span class="year">2011</span>, Taipei 101 received LEED platinum certification under "Existing Buildings: Operations and Maintenance". Although the project cost NT$60 million (US$2.08 million), it is expected to save 14.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, or an 18% energy-saving, equivalent to NT$36 million (US$1.2 million) in energy costs each year. In <span class="year">2019</span>, it was named among the 50 most influential skyscrapers in the world by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.</p>

        <p>On 4 January <span class="year">2020</span>, the building had a condolence message in lights for the victims of a helicopter crash, which included a number of senior government officials. On 8 February <span class="year">2020</span>, it was reported that that some passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise liner, quarantined for an outbreak of COVID-19, had visited Taipei 101 on 31 January at which point none exhibited symptoms. On 1 April <span class="year">2020</span>, the shopping center said it was reducing business hours due to the coronavirus pandemic. It had started checking shopper's temperatures in February. On 21 May the building said it would resume normal business hours in June, as the country had effectively limited the spread of COVID-19.</p>
